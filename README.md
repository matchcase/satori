# Satori Text Editor
## Introduction
Satori is an experiment in user interface design, that completely forgoes any form of traditional UI in favor of a completely LLM-oriented environment.
Everything from increasing the size of the font to itemizing lists is done via LLMs that blend seamlessly into the flow of typing, letting you focus on the text rather than the tool for editing the text.
